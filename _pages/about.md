I am a **CNRS Research Scientist** in the [**Biophysics of Complex Systems**](http://nmrbiolchem.univ-lyon1.fr/) team at [Institut des Sciences Analytiques](https://www.isa-lyon.fr/), France. 


My research falls under **computational molecular biophysics**, **physical chemistry**, and **integrative structural biology**.

I strive to understand how **biomolecular function** emerges from **structural dynamics** by describing the **atomically-detailed mechanisms** involved. 
For this, I combine **molecular dynamics simulations**, **machine learning**, and **experimental biophysics**. 

I investigate **complex molecular mechanisms** in systems ranging from short peptides to large **molecular motors** (myosin, ATP synthase), with the occasional venture into **supra-molecular chemistry**. I also contributed to characterizing the conformational dynamics and 
immunogenic sites of the **SARS-CoV-2 spike protein** in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. More recently, I started to explore how to apply **deep learning** methods to the analysis of **biophysical experiments**. 


I am always looking for motivated students to work with,
so check out the [open positions](/open-positions/) or contact me directly at `florian.blanc_at_isa-lyon.fr`.
